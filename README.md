### This project is showcasing the NLP model, and how it interacts with a dataset in additional data exploration

### Import Packages

### Import Data

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### DataFrame Manipulations
This section in the file is where we got the dataset ready for pre-processing for the model

### Models and Data Pre-Processing 
I stated that if a movie is successful if the revenue exceeds the budget of the movie

### Model
The model I chose to use is a Neural Network specifically coded for classification. This section also entails some data pre-processing


### Test_Train_Split
 - This is where I compile the actual model out.
 - Notice the activation function 'relu'. It keeps the results from only being 0 or 1 (classification)
 - I also include about 50% drop per each level of the network

### Prediction Testing
I chose to pick a random customer from the dataset, and the model predicted this cusomter would pay back their loans

### Conclusion
I, for some reason, could not get the classfication report to work, so I actually do not know how accurate this model (although with a Neural Network the accuracy is always fairly high.)
