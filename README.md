# PythonProjects
This Python project is all about credit card data and diving in on some in-depth analysis about it. Of course we had to see if we can predict some metrics about the given dataset. (This project also includes some pretty interesting graphics. They don't load originally but once you load the file yourself you should see them.)

Packages needed to run this project:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplot
- cufflinks
- seaborn
- xgboost
- plotly
- sklearn
