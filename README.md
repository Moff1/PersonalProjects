# PythonProjects
This is a mini project from another Data Science where the goal is perform basic analysis on a dataset of 911 calls. After the analysis we did some basic model building to see if we can accurately predict the category the 911 calls fall into. 

## Packages need for this project:
- import seaborn as sns
- import datetime 
- import numpy as np
- import matplotlib
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- import pandas as pd
- import tensorflow as tf
- import sklearn (version == 1.2.2)*

  * if you need to uninstall the sklearns package you have currently installed, create a cell and type this following command: 'pip uninstall scikit-learn -- yes'*
  * then type in this to import the right version: import sklearn (version == 1.2.2)*
