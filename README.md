### This project is to showcase my knowledge about SVM and some of their applications

### Import Data

### Data Loading - 
Using the famous IRIS dataset

### EDA

### Models (SVM)

### Pair Grid Search -  
This type of parameter tuning is pretty common. It take a dictionary of values for each parameter of the SVM model, and sorts through different combinations to get the best model possible


### Conclusion - 
As I thought this model is a clean model on a clean dataset. The accuracy was always going to be high. I would like to see how this model performs on a less perfect dataset.
