# A Spoitfy Story

This purpose of this project was to perform an analyis on my Spotify data from their Annual Spotify Wrapped (which is when they give everyone a basic overview of the music they listen to for that year. I decided to take it a few steps further and give a deeper analysis, incorporating components of data analysis, model creation/prediction, and broader Data Science topics. I hope you enjoy! (I also threw in a little NLP model, just to see if I could implement a pretty basic version).
