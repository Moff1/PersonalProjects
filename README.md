# PythonProjects
This Python project is a quick lab from one of my trainings where the goal is to create a simple algorithm for car prediction based on data provided in car_price_prediction.csv, and use XGBoost Regressor as the model. Took about 4hours total time to complete. 
### Packages needed to be downloaded (can be done in Jupyter Labs by typing 'pip install package name'):
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - matplotlib
 - seaborn
 - cufflinks
 - plotly
 - xgboost
 - sklearn
