# StarsAndSprinters
This project in specific I came up with just because of my love for the sport of track and field. The goal is to create a massive database of track and field athletes and times, and see just who the greats of the sports are by using facts. Throughout this project I demonstrate many web scraping techniques, as well as data cleaning methods. This project is not yet complete, but below will be guidelines as to how I came up with this project, and how to run it efficiently. 

**Note: As you move from college to professional you will see a cleaner way to scrape the data from the pro website I was using.**
